Ejercicio "Ordenar por orden lexicografico" (orden_lex.py)
Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]

Ejercicio "Break the camelCase" (break_cc.py)
Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Ejercicio "Detect an Pangram" (pangram.py)
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
